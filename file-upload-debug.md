# File Upload Debug Analysis

## Current Issue
User reports that when uploading files through the chat interface:
1. No console logs appear 
2. "Get AI Suggestions" button stays grey/disabled
3. No intelligent recommendations show up

## Expected Flow
1. User drops/selects files in InputArea
2. `attachedFiles` state updates → triggers useEffect debug log
3. User types message or clicks send
4. `handleSend` in InputArea calls `onFileUpload(attachedFiles)`
5. `App.handleFileUpload` processes files via `processFiles`
6. `useFileProcessor.processFiles` uploads to backend
7. Backend returns accounts data with session_id
8. `addMappings()` updates mappings state with new data
9. Mappings state update triggers "Get AI Suggestions" button to enable
10. `setShowIntelligentRecommendation(true)` shows the recommendation card

## Debugging Points Added

### InputArea.tsx
- ✅ Debug logs for file drop/selection
- ✅ Debug logs for attachedFiles state changes  
- ✅ Debug logs in handleSend for file processing

### App.tsx  
- ✅ Debug logs in handleFileUpload
- ✅ Debug logs for "Get AI Suggestions" button state
- ✅ Debug logs for mappings state changes

### useFileProcessor.ts
- ✅ Debug logs for processFiles function
- ✅ Debug logs for backend upload requests

## Test Plan

### Test 1: File Selection
1. Open browser dev tools console
2. Drop/select files in chat area
3. Expected logs:
   - `[InputArea] Files dropped:` or `[InputArea] Files selected via dialog:`
   - `[InputArea] Updated attachedFiles:`
   - `[InputArea] attachedFiles updated:`
   - `[InputArea] hasFiles for button: true`

### Test 2: File Upload Process  
1. Type message and send (or just send with files)
2. Expected logs:
   - `🔄 Processing files before sending message...`
   - `📁 App.handleFileUpload called with files:`
   - `[useFileProcessor] processFiles called with:`
   - `[useFileProcessor] Starting file processing`
   - `[useFileProcessor] Uploading file 1/1: filename.xlsx`
   - `[useFileProcessor] Upload response status: 200`
   - `[useFileProcessor] Upload successful for filename.xlsx`
   - `📊 processFiles completed, mappings: X`

### Test 3: Button State Updates
1. After file upload completes
2. Expected logs:
   - `🔘 Get AI Suggestions button state:` (should show enabled)
   - `🎯 Setting intelligent recommendation:` 

## Likely Issues

1. **Files not attaching**: attachedFiles state not updating
2. **handleSend not called**: Send button/enter not working  
3. **Backend communication**: Upload request failing silently
4. **State updates**: Mappings not updating, button stays disabled
5. **Missing dependencies**: React imports or hook dependencies

## Test With Simple HTML
Created test-upload.html to test backend upload directly:
- Bypasses React component complexity
- Tests pure file upload to backend
- Isolates backend vs frontend issues
