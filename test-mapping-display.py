Please analyze the uploaded FIS IO accounts and provide mapping suggestions in the following structured format:

For each account, provide:
1. [ACCOUNT_CODE] -> [SUGGESTED_TARGET] (confidence%)
   Reasoning: [explanation]

Please analyze the first 5 accounts and suggest appropriate target mappings with confidence scores.
Format your response with clear mapping suggestions that can be parsed.

Sample format:
1. 1000 -> CASH-001 (85%)
   Reasoning: Cash account mapping based on account type

2. 1010 -> BANK-CHK (90%)
   Reasoning: Checking account mapping
   
Please provide structured mapping suggestions for the uploaded accounts.
